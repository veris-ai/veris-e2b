# veris-e2b

Veris interception for [E2B](https://e2b.dev): vendor API calls made inside an
E2B sandbox are answered by a stateful Veris twin, and every run ends with a
receipt of what the vendor actually received.

Two packages, one repo, because they move together.

| package | what it is |
|---|---|
| [`@veris-ai/e2b`](./e2b) | The SDK. A drop-in subclass of E2B's `Sandbox` whose `create()` also provisions the twin, points the sandbox's egress at the Veris gateway and installs the interception CA — and whose `kill()` deletes the twin with it. |
| [`@veris-ai/e2b-opencode`](./e2b-opencode) | An OpenCode plugin. One line in `opencode.json` and every session in that repo runs in a Veris-intercepted sandbox. |

`@veris-ai/e2b@0.1.1` is SDK-only. This PR adds no CLI;
[CLI draft #22](https://github.com/veris-ai/veris-e2b/pull/22) is separate and
requires a future npm release before its commands can be used.

## Shared skills in OpenCode

Use the canonical `@veris-ai/veris-opencode` skills package plus **one** sandbox
plugin after the pending skills 0.7.3 and provider 0.2.0 releases are published:

```json
{
  "plugin": [
    "@veris-ai/veris-opencode@latest",
    "@veris-ai/e2b-opencode@latest"
  ]
}
```

The commands are `/veris:setup`, `/veris:build <request>` and `/veris:fix <request>`.
`verisSkill` reads installed skill resources on the host; application file/bash
tools remain remote. `verisTwin` identifies the plugin-owned session and controls,
and `verisReceipt` takes an explicit pre-execution baseline. Skills reuse this
session automatically. Record and pin the resolved published npm versions.
See [e2b-opencode/README.md](e2b-opencode/README.md) for the capability
contract, separate network/TLS/persistence/sync behavior and release prerequisites.


## The SDK

```ts
import { Sandbox } from '@veris-ai/e2b'   // was: 'e2b'

const sbx = await Sandbox.create()
await sbx.commands.run('curl -sS https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers -u sk_test_veris:')
await sbx.veris.assertTouched('stripe')
await sbx.kill()
```

Every E2B option still works — it is a real subclass — so an existing template
or workflow keeps working with the import changed. Details in
[`e2b/README.md`](./e2b/README.md) and [`e2b/docs/reference.md`](./e2b/docs/reference.md).

## The CLI

`@veris-ai/e2b` also builds the `veris-e2b` executable for a separately managed
application-test box: `provision` attaches to an existing twin, `push` uploads
local code, `exec` runs commands with trust applied, and `teardown` deletes only
that box. It reads the Veris CLI's login profile and keeps E2B's template,
network and lifetime behavior. See the [CLI guide](e2b/docs/cli.md) for the
version-pinned `npx` workflow and release availability check.

**Release prerequisite:** npm 0.1.1 does not include this executable. The CLI
must ship in a new published release before the documented `npx` flow is usable.

## The OpenCode plugin

```jsonc
// opencode.json
{ "plugin": ["@veris-ai/e2b-opencode"] }
```

The agent's `bash`, `read`, `write` and the rest execute in the sandbox while the
reasoning loop stays on your machine — so the sandbox never holds your model
key. Adds a `verisReceipt` tool, because an agent that fabricated an API response
and one that really called it produce identical transcripts. They produce
different receipts. See [`e2b-opencode/README.md`](./e2b-opencode/README.md).

## Install

```sh
npm i @veris-ai/e2b              # the SDK
npm i @veris-ai/e2b-opencode     # the OpenCode plugin (pulls the SDK with it)
```

Both packages version together, so a given plugin version always resolves the
SDK it was built against.

## Working in this repo

```sh
npm install          # links both workspaces
npm run build        # must come first, see CONTRIBUTING.md
npm run typecheck
npm test             # unit tests for both packages
npm run test:live    # SDK only; needs E2B_API_KEY, VERIS_API_KEY, VERIS_ENVIRONMENT_ID
```
