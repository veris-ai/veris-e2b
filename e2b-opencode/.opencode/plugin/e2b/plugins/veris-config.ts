 * The MCP is the shared home for twin LIFECYCLE (get, promote, reset). Keeping
 * it there rather than reimplementing those as plugin tools is what stops a
 * second engine plugin from having to grow the same surface again: the only
 * thing to copy is this file.
 *
 * Everything is `??=`, so a user's own opencode.json always wins and someone who
 * already has `@veris-ai/veris-sim-opencode` installed globally gets no double
 * registration. The whole body is wrapped: a failed registration should surface
 * as a missing MCP server, never as OpenCode failing to start.

 * Defaults for the MCP's destructive tools. The plugin creates and owns this

 *
 *   create_sandbox   makes a twin the plugin does not know about. Traffic still
 *                    goes to the plugin's twin and verisReceipt still reads the
 *                    plugin's twin, so the agent would seed the orphan and then
 *                    report success — the exact failure the receipt exists to
 *                    catch, reintroduced one layer up.
 *   delete_sandbox   destroys the running session's twin. The egress credential
 *                    dies with it and every later call fails obscurely.
 *   promote_sandbox  legitimate, but it freezes and scrubs the sandbox AND
 *                    rewrites what every future run in the environment starts
 *                    from. That is a human's decision.
 *   reset_sandbox    legitimate, but it clears /veris/requests, which is the
 *                    receipt.
